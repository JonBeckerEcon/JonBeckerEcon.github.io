**This website is under construction**

Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at New York University.  

**I am going to be on the 2024-2025 job market.**

My research interests are primarily in macroeconomics, with a focus on consumption and inequality. I have also worked on topics in information theory and spatial economics.

**Asymmetric Markup-Dynamics in Recessions** <br />

Micro-data reveals significant polarization in consumption patterns along the quality margin. Richer households opt for pricier goods and households are least price-elastic vis-a-vis their favored choice of quality. The exertion of market power is disciplined through moderately price-elastic middle-class consumers who are willing to substitute along the quality margin. Accommodating these features of the data, I study a partial equilibrium model of oligopolistic product market competition with nonhomothetic preferences. Firms' price-setting strategies are informed by the composition of their customer base. I demarcate a markup channel that allows for the expenditure distribution to affect macro aggregates. Observed shifts in spending patterns during the 2008-2009 financial crisis increase prices for low-quality goods by 7.25%, while decreasing prices for high-quality goods by 2.63%. Over the great recession, the markup channel accounts for approximately 15% of the welfare-losses for lower-income consumers and compensates affluent consumers for about 5% of their losses.

**Local Concentration, National Concentration, and the Spatial Distribution of Markups** (with Chris Edmond, Virgiliu Midrigan, and Daniel Yi Xu) <br />

We study the spatial distribution of production and consumption in a quantitative model with multi-establishment firms, oligopolistic competition, and endogenously variable markups. We calibrate our model to match US Census of Manufactures firm and establishment data and intranational trade flows from the Commodity Flows Survey. We show that spatial frictions can have large aggregate effects, increasing both the aggregate markup and the productivity losses due to misallocation. We then show that a reduction in intranational trade costs, calibrated to match long-run trends in US manufacturing, will increase national sales concentration but decrease local sales concentration. Local markets become more competitive, markups fall, and aggregate productivity rises, despite the increase in national concentration.

**Entry under Information-Frictions** <br />

I study the welfare-impact of entry-stage information frictions in the US macroeconomy. The framework for this exercise is a simple Chamberlinian model with heterogenous firms, entry-stage selection, and rigidities in capital adjustments. The severity of information frictions is governed by the precision of a private signal on firm-level fundamentals. Leveraging data on exit rates and capital adjustments among comparatively young establishments, the model is calibrated to US Census of Manufactures and BDS data. I find that a  reduction of information frictions over time is consistent with a number of well-documented secular trends: a rise in concentration, an increase in profitability, as well as a decoupling of wage- and productivity-growth. The welfare-gains to be had from a counterfactual elimination of  entry-stage information frictions are roughly 10% in consumption-equivalent terms.
