Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at New York University.  

**I am going to be on the 2024-2025 job market.**

My research interests are primarily in macroeconomics, with a focus on consumption and inequality. I have also worked on topics in information theory and spatial economics.

**Asymmetric Markup-Dynamics in Recessions** <br />

<small>This paper quantifies the unequal response of markups to a recessionary shift in demand patterns. In recessions households smooth consumption along the quality margin. The corresponding shift in demand weakens the competitive link between low and high quality producers. As a consequence, low quality producers gain market power and charge higher markups. Prices faced by poor households increase relative to those faced by the rich. In order to quantify this markup channel, I study a static partial equilibrium model with nonhomothetic preferences and endogenously variable markups. I calibrate the model to match micro-evidence on differences in consumer choices across the expenditure distribution. Observed changes in the expenditure distribution during the Great Recession lead to an 8 pp increase in low-quality markups, while high-quality markups decrease by 2 pp. When embedded into a dynamic general equilibrium setting this mechanism amplifies the business cycle through its impact on labor supply.</small><br>

**Local Concentration, National Concentration, and the Spatial Distribution of Markups** <br />
(with Chris Edmond, Virgiliu Midrigan, and Daniel Yi Xu) [ <a href="https://jonbeckerecon.github.io/files" style="color: #1f4263; text-decoration: none;" onmouseover="style='color: #1f4263; text-decoration:underline;'" onmouseout="style='color: #1f4263; text-decoration:none;'">Draft soon</a> | <a href="https://jonbeckerecon.github.io/files" style="color: #1f4263; text-decoration: none;" onmouseover="style='color: #1f4263; text-decoration:underline;'" onmouseout="style='color: #1f4263; text-decoration:none;'">Slides soon</a> ]

<small>We study the spatial distribution of production and consumption in a quantitative model with multi-establishment firms, oligopolistic competition, and endogenously variable markups. We calibrate our model to match US Census of Manufactures firm and establishment data and intranational trade flows from the Commodity Flows Survey. We show that spatial frictions can have large aggregate effects, increasing both the aggregate markup and the productivity losses due to misallocation. We then show that a reduction in intranational trade costs, calibrated to match long-run trends in US manufacturing, will increase national sales concentration but decrease local sales concentration. Local markets become more competitive, markups fall, and aggregate productivity rises, despite the increase in national concentration.</small><br>

**Entry under Information-Frictions** <br />
(Best Third-Year Paper Award) [ <a href="https://jonbeckerecon.github.io/files" style="color: #1f4263; text-decoration: none;" onmouseover="style='color: #1f4263; text-decoration:underline;'" onmouseout="style='color: #1f4263; text-decoration:none;'">Draft soon</a> | <a href="https://jonbeckerecon.github.io/files" style="color: #1f4263; text-decoration: none;" onmouseover="style='color: #1f4263; text-decoration:underline;'" onmouseout="style='color: #1f4263; text-decoration:none;'">Slides soon</a> ]

<small>I study the welfare-impact of entry-stage information frictions in the US macroeconomy. The framework for this exercise is a simple Chamberlinian model with heterogenous firms, entry-stage selection, and rigidities in capital adjustments. The severity of information frictions is governed by the precision of a private signal on firm-level fundamentals. Leveraging data on exit rates and capital adjustments among comparatively young establishments, the model is calibrated to US Census of Manufactures and BDS data. I find that a  reduction of information frictions over time is consistent with a number of well-documented secular trends: a rise in concentration, an increase in profitability, as well as a decoupling of wage- and productivity-growth. The welfare-gains from a counterfactual elimination of  entry-stage information frictions are roughly 10% in consumption-equivalent terms.</small><br>
