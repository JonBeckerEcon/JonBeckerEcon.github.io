Welcome! I am a PhD candidate in Economics at New York University.  

My research interests are primarily in macroeconomics, with a focus on consumption and inequality. I have also worked on topics in information theory and spatial economics. Here is my [CV](files/).

**I am going to be on the 2024-2025 job market.**
